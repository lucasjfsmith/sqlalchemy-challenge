## Analysis
In the first part of the assignment we analyzed both the precipitation and station data

### Precipitation Analysis
For the precipitation analysis, we manipulated and plotted the data to visualize the inches of precipitation per day.

### Station Analysis
For the station analysis, we determined the station with the most data points and then created a histogram to see the frequency of each temperature.

## Climate App
The climate app is a Flask API that shows us precipiation, station, and temperature data similar to what was done in the analysis portion of the assignment.

It also allows a user to input a start and end date into the API request and see minimum, maximum, and average temperatures for the given time period.
