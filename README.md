## Analysis
In the first part of the assignment we analyzed both the precipitation and station data

### Precipitation Analysis
For the precipitation analysis, we manipulated and plotted the data to visualize the inches of precipitation per day.

### Station Analysis
For the station analysis, we determined the station with the most data points and then created a histogram to see the frequency of each temperature.
